This program has been implemented for the research presented in the article "Evaluation and Efficiency Comparison of Evolutionary Algorithms for Service Placement Optimization in Fog Architectures", submitted for evaluation in the journal "Future Generation Computer Systems".


These are the implementations of three genetic algorithms (weighted sum, NSGA-II, and MOEA/D) for the placement of fog applications. They are implemented in python 2.7. For more details, please, read the article in TBD.

This program is released under the GPLv3 License.

**Please consider to cite this work as**:

```bash

```

**Execution of the program**:

```bash
    python caller.py
```
The different configuration of the experiments are called with  "subprocess.call" to facilitate a future implementation with threads.
